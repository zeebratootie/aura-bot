Command Line Interface
======================

# Overview

[Aura][1]'s CLI provides a set of flags and parameters to configure and control the bot's behavior
when hosting games, or to host games themselves.

Below is a detailed explanation of each flag and parameter along with usage examples.

# Positional arguments

## \`\<MAP\> \<NAME\>\`
Hosts a game with the given name, using a given map file.

- `<MAP>`: The name or identifier of the map to be hosted.
- `<NAME>`: The desired name for the hosted game session.

If ``MAP`` has no slashes, it's resolved relative to Aura's map dir by default.
When it has slashes, or ``--stdpaths`` is used, it's resolved relative to the current working directory (CWD).

## \`\<CONFIG\> \<NAME\>\`
Hosts a game with the given name, using a given map config/metadata file.

- `<CONFIG>`: The configuration settings for the game.
- `<NAME>`: The desired name for the hosted game session.

If ``CONFIG`` has no slashes, it's resolved relative to Aura's map config dir by default.
When it has slashes, or ``--stdpaths`` is used, it's resolved relative to the current working directory (CWD).

# Flags

## \`--about\`

Displays the information of Aura, including its version.

## \`--help\`

Displays usage information and a list of available flags and parameters.

## \`--verbose\`

Displays more detailed information when running CLI actions.

## \`--stdpaths\`

When enabled, this flag instructs Aura to utilize standard paths for directories and files 
entered from the CLI. That is, it makes them relative to the current working directory (CWD).

Notably, it also ensures that map and configuration file paths are interpreted exactly as entered, thus 
disabling fuzzy-matching. However, it's important to note that this flag removes protection against 
[arbitrary directory traversal][3]. Therefore, it should only be used for paths that have been thoroughly validated.

Additionally, the following CLI flags are affected by ``--stdpaths``:
- ``--config <FILE>``. When stdpaths is disabled and FILE has no slashes, it resolves relative to Aura's home dir.

This option is commutative.

## \`--init-system\`

When enabled, this flag instructs Aura to install itself to various relevant places.

- User PATH environment variable. This allows easily invoking Aura from anywhere in the CLI.
- Windows Explorer context menu. This allows easily hosting WC3 map files by right-clicking them.

This option is enabled by default when Aura is executed for the first time.

## \`--no-init-system\`

When enabled, this flag instructs Aura NOT to install itself to various relevant places. 
This can help in avoiding cluttering the system GUI and environment variables.

## \`--auto-port-forward\`

This flag enables Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) functionality within the game 
server. UPnP allows devices to discover and communicate with each other, 
facilitating automatic port forwarding on routers that support this protocol.

When the --auto-port-forward flag is enabled, the game server will attempt to 
automatically configure port forwarding on compatible routers using UPnP. This 
feature is particularly useful for hosting multiplayer game sessions, as it 
ensures that incoming connections from players outside the local network can 
reach the server without manual intervention to configure port forwarding on 
the router.

Note:
- UPnP support must be enabled on the router for this feature to work.
- Some routers may require user authentication for UPnP requests.

This flag is enabled by default.

## \`--no-auto-port-forward\`

Conversely, this flag flag is used to explicitly disable Universal Plug and Play 
(UPnP) functionality within the game server. When this flag is set, the game server 
will not attempt to automatically configure port forwarding using UPnP, even if 
UPnP is supported by the router.

This may be desirable in situations where manual port forwarding configurations are 
preferred, or if there are concerns about security risks associated with UPnP.

Disabling UPnP may require manual configuration of port forwarding rules on the router, 
which could be inconvenient for game hosts. Ensure that you can properly handle the 
implications of using this flag.

This option is equivalent to ``<net.port_forwarding.upnp.enabled = no>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--lan\`

This flag indicates that any hosted games should be available in the 
"Local Area Network" game menu. When this flag is used, hosted games 
will be available to players on the same network, as well as players 
sharing the same VPNs or the IPv6 TCP tunneling mechanism. 
See [NETWORKING.md][2] for more information.

This option is equivalent to ``<net.game_discovery.udp.enabled = yes>`` in `config.ini`

This flag is enabled by default.

## \`--no-lan\`

Conversely, this flag indicates that the game should NOT be available in the 
"Local Area Network" game menu. When this flag is used, hosted games 
will NOT be available to players on the same network, nor to players 
sharing the same VPNs or the IPv6 TCP tunneling mechanism. 
See [NETWORKING.md][2] for more information.

This option is equivalent to ``<net.game_discovery.udp.enabled = no>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--bnet\`

Sets all Battle.net/PvPGN realms registered in `config.ini` to enabled. This flag overrides 
any ``realm_N.enabled = no`` entries in the configuration file. This forces hosted games 
to be playable over the internet through Blizzard's Battle.net platform, as well as 
through alternative PvPGN servers.

This option is equivalent to ``<bot.toggle_every_realm = yes>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--no-bnet\`

Sets all Battle.net/PvPGN realms registered in `config.ini` to disabled. This prevents Aura from 
connecting to them. If this flag is enabled, games cannot be played over the internet through 
Blizzard's Battle.net platform, nor through alternative PvPGN servers.

This option is equivalent to ``<bot.toggle_every_realm = no>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--irc\`

When enabled, this flag instructs Aura to connect to the configured IRC server.

This option is equivalent to ``<irc.enabled = yes>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--no-irc\`

When enabled, this flag instructs Aura not to connect to IRC.

This option is equivalent to ``<irc.enabled = no>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--discord\`

When enabled, this flag instructs Aura to connect to Discord using the defined configuration.

This option is equivalent to ``<discord.enabled = yes>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--no-discord\`

When enabled, this flag instructs Aura not to connect to Discord.

This option is equivalent to ``<discord.enabled = no>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--exit\`

Enables the option to automatically exit the bot after hosting all games queued through the CLI. 
When this option is enabled, the bot will terminate itself once the hosting process is completed. 
When any games are created from the CLI, this option is automatically enabled by default.

## \`--no-exit\`

Disables the option to automatically exit the bot after hosting all games queued through the CLI. 
When this option is enabled, the bot will terminate itself once the hosting process is completed.

## \`--cache\`

Enables caching of map metadata for faster loading times and improved performance during gameplay. 
When caching is enabled, certain map data is stored locally to reduce loading times for subsequent 
sessions.

This option is enabled by default when no games are hosted from the CLI.

## \`--no-cache\`

Disables caching of map metadata. When caching is disabled, game data is not stored locally, and 
each session may experience longer loading times as a result. This option is enabled by default 
when hosting games from the CLI.

## \`--check-jass\`

When you use this flag, Aura will automatically check map scripts for correctness.
This improves game experience by disabling hosting of bugged maps.

## \`--no-check-jass\`

By using this flag, you're indicating that you'd like Aura to host maps regardless of their 
scripts correctness. This can be useful for preliminary map testing or running maps that may 
not be fully supported by the jass checker.

## \`--extract-jass\`

When you use this flag, Aura will automatically extract necessary files from your game 
installation. These files are crucial for hosting games directly from game map files. Aura 
does all the work for you, making sure everything is set up correctly behind the scenes.

**Why Use `--extract-jass`?**
- **Convenience**: With this flag, you don't need to worry about manually obtaining files. Aura takes care of it for you.
- **Saves Time**: No need to spend extra time finding and extracting files yourself.
- **Ensures Compatibility**: Extracting the necessary files ensures compatibility with a wide range of game versions.

## \`--no-extract-jass\`

By using this flag, you're indicating that you prefer to handle the extraction of necessary files 
manually. Although Aura won't do it for you automatically, you still have the flexibility 
to obtain and manage these files as you see fit.

**Why Use `--no-extract-jass`?**
- **Manual Control**: Some users prefer to have full control over file management.
- **Customization**: You might have specific preferences or procedures for obtaining these files.
- **Already Extracted**: If you've already extracted the files or prefer a different method, this 
flag allows you to bypass automatic extraction.

**Note**: Even if JASS files are unavailable, you can still host games using map config 
files (``.ini``). These flags simply determine how files necessary for hosting from map files 
(``.w3x``, ``.w3m``) are obtained and managed.

# Parameters

## \`--homedir \<DIRECTORY\>\`

Specifies the directory to be used as Aura's home directory. Paths in the config file are resolved relative to the home directory.

- This flag takes precedence over any other method of determining the home directory, including environment variables.
- If `--homedir` is not provided, the environment variable `AURA_HOME` is used to determine the home directory.
- If neither `--homedir` nor the `AURA_HOME` environment variable are set, the home directory defaults to the directory where Aura's executable is located.

## \`--config \<FILE\>\`

Specifies the location of Aura's main configuration file.

- If `<FILE>` does not contain any slashes, it is resolved relative to the home directory by default, unless overridden by the `--stdpaths` flag.
- The presence of any slashes causes `<FILE>` to be resolved relative to the current working directory (CWD).
- When using `--config`, if the configuration file is not located within the home directory, the bot may only start up if the configuration file includes the entry `<bot.home_path.allow_mismatch = yes>`.

**Note**: Paths in any configuration file are resolved relative to Aura's home directory.

Defaults to ``config.ini`` in the home dir.

## \`--config-adapter \<FILE\>\`

Specifies the location of a file to be used to migrate legacy Ghost++ configuration files (e.g. `default.cfg`) into modern Aura configuration files.

When this option is specified, Aura will read the legacy configuration file at the location specified by `--config` (or at the default location). 
Then, the file specified by `--config-adapter` will be used in order to convert the former, creating a modern Aura configuration file with 
the name `config-migrated.ini`.

It's recommended that users check that the contents of a generated config file matches both their expectation and Aura's expectations, by 
contrasting key-value pairs with those documented as allowed in `CONFIG.md`.

After manually fixing any remaining issues, a generated config file should be renamed to `config.ini`, so that Aura automatically uses it.

**Note**: Paths in any configuration file are resolved relative to Aura's home directory.

## \`--w3dir \<DIRECTORY\>\` 

Specifies the directory where the Warcraft 3 game files are located. This parameter allows Aura 
to identify and fetch files from alternative Warcraft 3 game installations on the spot.

This option is equivalent to ``<game.install_path>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--mapdir \<DIRECTORY\>\`

Specifies the directory where Warcraft 3 maps are stored. This parameter allows Aura to locate  
and load maps for hosting games.

This option is equivalent to ``<bot.maps_path>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--cfgdir \<DIRECTORY\>\`

Specifies the directory path where Aura reads metadata files for Warcraft 3 maps. 
These metadata files, also known as "map config" files or mapcfg, are essential 
for hosting games, and can be used as the source of truth even if the original map 
files are unavailable.

This option enables users to specify a custom directory for Aura to locate existing map 
metadata. It's particularly useful for organizing and accessing map configurations 
separately from other application data.

This option is equivalent to ``<bot.map_configs_path>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--cachedir \<DIRECTORY\>\`

Specifies the directory path where Aura automatically generates and stores cache files 
for Warcraft 3 maps. These cache files serve the same purpose as user-created metadata 
files, but are generated by the application to optimize performance.

Separating cache files from user-created files allows for better organization and 
maintenance of map metadata.

This option is equivalent to ``<bot.map_cache_path>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--jassdir \<DIRECTORY\>\`

Specifies the directory where Warcraft 3 script files are stored. These files are needed in order 
to host games from map files (``.w3x``, ``.w3m``).

This option is equivalent to ``<bot.jass_path>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--savedir \<DIRECTORY\>\`

Specifies the directory where Warcraft 3 save files (``.w3z``) are stored.

This option is equivalent to ``<bot.save_path>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--data-version \<VERSION\>\`

Specifies the version that is to be used when hosting Warcraft 3 games. This parameter allows Aura to switch 
versions on the spot.

Note that, while Aura supports some degree of cross-version compatibility, the version specified by this parameter is assumed in 
case Aura cannot figure out the version used by a game client.

This option is equivalent to ``<game.install_version>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--cache-revalidate \<METHOD\>\`

Specifies the method used to revalidate the cached map configurations.

**Options:**

- never: Never try to validate the cached configurations against the maps they are based on.
- always: Always validate the cached configurations against the maps they are based on.
- modified: Only validate the cached configurations against the maps they are based on if modifications are detected in the map.

This option is equivalent to ``<bot.load_maps.cache.revalidation.algorithm>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--bind-address \<IPv4>\`

If specified, Aura's game server will bind to the provided IPv4 address. This means that only computers 
running in the associated network will be able to connect to the games.

The most interesting value is \`127.0.0.1\`, which will only allow connections from your 
[loopback interface][4] (i.e. connections only from the local machine where the server is running.)

\`0.0.0.0\` is a special value that will allow connections from every IPv4 address. Other values may be 
used according to your network configuration.

This option is equivalent to ``<net.bind_address>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--host-port \<PORT>\`

If specified, Aura's game server will listen exclusively at the provided port.
Note that \`0.0.0.0\` is a special value that will allow connections from every IPv4 address.

This option is equivalent to ``<net.host_port.only>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--udp-lan-mode \<MODE\>\`

Specifies how hosted games available for "Local Area Network" should be made known to potential players 
running game clients up to v1.29.

**Options:**

- strict: Exclusively uses back-and-forth communication with interested game clients. Aura's server sends 
tiny periodic messages over the network that prompts open Warcraft III clients to request further 
information. Once Aura provides them with that information, game clients may join your hosted game.

This option is equivalent to ``<net.game_discovery.udp.broadcast.strict = yes>`` in `config.ini`

- lax: Aura periodically sends the full information needed to join a hosted game to all machines in the 
same network. Additionally, it will reply to the information request that happens when a game client first 
opens the "Local Area Network" menu.

This option is equivalent to ``<net.game_discovery.udp.broadcast.strict = no>`` in `config.ini`

- free: Aura periodically sends the full information needed to join a hosted game to all machines in the 
same network. It will not reply to any information requests, nor process any UDP traffic. Port 6112 is not 
used by Aura's UDP server. This is the only UDP mode that allows a Warcraft III game client in the host 
machine to connect to the Local Area Network.

This option is equivalent to ``<net.udp_server.enabled = no>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--log-level \<LEVEL\>\`

Specifies the level of detail for logging output.

Values:
 - trace2: Extremely detailed information, typically used for deep debugging purposes.
 - trace: Detailed information, providing a high level of insight into the bot's internal operations.
 - debug: Fine-grained informational events that are most useful for debugging purposes.
 - info: Confirmation that things are working as expected.
 - notice: Normal but significant events that may require attention.
 - warning: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future.
 - error: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.
 - critical: A serious error that may prevent the bot from functioning correctly.

By default, the logging level is set to info.

## \`--port-forward-tcp \<PORT\>\`, \`--port-forward-udp \<PORT\>\`

The ``--port-forward-tcp <PORT>`` and ``--port-forward-udp <PORT>`` flags are used to trigger 
Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) requests from the command line interface (CLI) for TCP and UDP 
port forwarding, respectively. These flags facilitate the hosting and discovery of multiplayer games 
by allowing incoming connections on specific ports.

  TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):

      The ``--port-forward-tcp <PORT>`` flag initiates UPnP requests to forward TCP traffic on the specified port.
      TCP is used for establishing connections between the game server and multiple clients for multiplayer gameplay.
      Enabling TCP port forwarding ensures that incoming TCP connections can reach the game server, allowing players to join multiplayer games seamlessly.

  UDP (User Datagram Protocol):

      The ``--port-forward-udp <PORT>`` flag initiates UPnP requests to forward UDP traffic on the specified port.
      UDP is utilized for server and client communication to discover hosted games and exchange game data efficiently.
      Enabling UDP port forwarding ensures that UDP packets related to game discovery and communication can reach the game server and clients.

**Note:**
- Ensure that the specified ports are not blocked by firewalls and are available for use.
- UPnP support must be enabled on the router for these requests to be successful.
- Some routers may require user authentication for UPnP requests. Aura does not support this.

# Flags for CLI games

## \`--check-joinable\`, \`--no-check-joinable\`

This flag enables automatic connectivity checks to ensure hosted games are joinable from the Internet.

This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--check-reservation\`, \`--no-check-reservation\`

This flag enables reservation checks to ensure only players with reservations may join games.

This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--replaceable\`, \`--no-replaceable\`

This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--auto-rehost\`, \`--no-auto-rehost\`

This flag enables automatic rehosting of the same game setup so long as Aura is not hosting another lobby.

This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--notify-joins\`, \`--no-notify-joins\`

This flag enables sound notifications when a player joins the hosted game.

This flag is equivalent to to ``<ui.notify_joins.enabled>`` in `config.ini`.
This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--lobby-chat\`, \`--no-lobby-chat\`

This flag enables chat among players in the hosted game lobby.

This flag is equivalent to to ``<hosting.chat_lobby.enabled>`` in `config.ini`.

This flag is equivalent to to ``<hosting.chat_lobby.enabled>`` in in map configuration.

This flag is enabled by default.

## \`--in-game-chat\`, \`--no-in-game-chat\`

This flag enables chat among players in the hosted game after it's started.

This flag is equivalent to to ``<hosting.chat_in_game.enabled>`` in `config.ini`.

This flag is equivalent to to ``<hosting.chat_in_game.enabled>`` in in map configuration.

This flag is enabled by default.

## \`--tft\`

This flag enables Warcraft III: Frozen Throne &#9415; support for the hosted game.

A game may only target either Reign of Chaos or Frozen Throne. Therefore, `--tft` is incompatible with `--roc`.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.game_versions.expansion.default = TFT>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.game_versions.expansion.default = TFT>`` in map configuration

This flag is enabled by default.

## \`--roc\`

This flag enables Warcraft III: Frozen Throne &#9415; support for the hosted game.

A game may only target either Reign of Chaos or Frozen Throne. Therefore, `--roc` is incompatible with `--tft`.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.game_versions.expansion.default = ROC>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.game_versions.expansion.default = ROC>`` in map configuration

This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--ffa\`

This flag forces players joining the game into different teams.

This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--lock-teams\`, \`--no-lock-teams\`

This flag enforces fair play in team games. When disabled, players are allowed to arbitrarily change their
diplomatic relationship to other players, including.
- Becoming allied or foes.
- Sharing vision or unsharing it, even with foes.
- Sharing units or unsharing them, only with (current) allies.
- Sharing your victory conditions with your allies ('Allied Victory'.)
- Trading resources with foes.

This flag is enabled by default.

## \`--teams-together\`, \`--no-teams-together\`

This flag enables automatic grouping of teammates' starting positions.

This flag is enabled by default.

## \`--share-advanced\`, \`--no-share-advanced\`

This flag enables 'Advanced Shared Unit Control'. When this setting is active, if a player shares their units 
with someone else, they will be allowed to train units, and build structures on their behalf.

This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--random-races\`

This flag enables randomization of player races in the hosted game. When this flag is used, each player's 
race will be randomly assigned at the start of the game session. This adds an element of unpredictability 
and variety to the game, as players may need to adapt their strategies based on their randomly assigned race.

This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--random-heroes\`

This flag enables randomization of player heroes in the hosted game. With this flag, each player's hero will 
be randomly selected at the beginning of the game session. Randomizing heroes adds excitement and diversity 
to the gameplay, as players must adapt their tactics based on the strengths and abilities of their randomly 
assigned hero.

This flag is disabled by default.

## `--allow-save`

When enabled, this flag allows players to save the game during a multiplayer 
session. Saving can be useful for long matches, allowing players to resume later 
without losing progress.

Saving games is particularly beneficial for:
- **Extended matches**, where a single session may take hours to complete.
- **Competitive games**, enabling organizers to recover from disconnections or 
  technical issues.
- **Co-op campaigns**, where players may want to continue at a later time.

This flag is enabled by default.

## `--no-allow-save`

When enabled, this flag disables the ability to save the game during a 
multiplayer session. This ensures that games must be completed in a single sitting, 
which may be desirable for competitive integrity or game modes that do not 
support reloading.

Disabling game saves may be useful in:
- **Ranked matches**, where restoring a game state could be exploited.
- **Fast-paced games**, where interruptions could affect the flow of play.
- **One-time events or tournaments**, where matches are expected to conclude 
  in a single session.

This option ensures that all matches must be played from start to finish without 
the ability to reload a prior state.

This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--ownerless\`

This flag prevents players from taking ownership of the hosted game.

This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--latency-equalizer\`

When enabled, this flag activates the latency equalizer, ensuring that all 
players in a multiplayer session experience similar input delays. This helps 
to maintain fairness by preventing players with lower latency from having an 
advantage over those with higher latency.

The equalizer dynamically adjusts input processing times based on the highest 
latency detected among connected players, keeping the gameplay experience 
consistent for everyone.

This flag is disabled by default.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.latency.equalizer.enabled>`` in `config.ini`.

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.latency.equalizer.enabled>`` in map configuration

## \`--no-latency-equalizer\`

When enabled, this flag disables the latency equalizer, allowing players to 
experience input delays based on their individual network conditions. Players 
with lower latency will receive faster response times, while those with 
higher latency may experience delays.

This option may be useful in scenarios where reducing input lag for low-latency 
players is prioritized over maintaining synchronized delays for all players.

This flag is enabled by default.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.latency.equalizer.enabled>`` in `config.ini`.

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.latency.equalizer.enabled>`` in map configuration

## \`--latency-normalize\`

This flag automatically synchronizes the network state of players in the hosted game, in such a game that some 
apparent lag issues at the game start get automatically fixed over time.

This flag is enabled by default.

## \`--no-latency-normalize\`

This flag prevents the automatic network synchronization mechanism. When this flag is used, lag screens with a 
long or even permanent duration may show up when some games start, rendering it unplayable.

This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--lag-screen\`

When enabled, this flag instructs the game to pause when significant lag issues 
are detected in a multiplayer session. This ensures that all players experience 
the game at the same pace, preventing unfair advantages or desynchronization.

The game will remain paused until the lag issue is resolved, at which point it 
will automatically resume.

This flag is enabled by default.

This option is equivalent to ``<net.lag_screen.enabled>`` in `config.ini`.

This option is equivalent to ``<map.net.lag_screen.enabled>`` in map configuration

## \`--no-lag-screen\`

When enabled, this flag disables the automatic pausing of the game during lag 
spikes. Instead of pausing, the game will continue running in real-time, 
potentially causing some players to experience delays or desynchronization.

This option may be preferable for games where uninterrupted action is 
prioritized over synchronization.

This flag is disabled by default.

This option is equivalent to ``<net.lag_screen.enabled>`` in `config.ini`.

This option is equivalent to ``<map.net.lag_screen.enabled>`` in map configuration

## \`--hide-ign\`

This flag prevents users joining a hosted game from knowing the nicknames of other players before the game starts.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.nicknames.hide_lobby>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.nicknames.hide_lobby>`` in map configuration

This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--no-hide-ign\`

This flag allows users joining a hosted game to know the nicknames of other players before the game starts.

This option corresponds to ``<hosting.nicknames.hide_lobby>`` in `config.ini`

This option corresponds to ``<map.hosting.nicknames.hide_lobby>`` in map configuration

This flag is enabled by default.

## \`--load-in-game\`

This flag allows players into the game, in a paused state, as soon as each of them finishes loading. 
This allows them to preview the game map and chat together, while waiting for others to finish loading 
the game themselves.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.load_in_game.enabled>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.load_in_game.enabled>`` in map configuration

This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--no-load-in-game\`

This flag ensures the game loading screen stays up before every player has finished loading the game.
This ensures that faster players will not get unfair advantages due to previewing the map too early.

This option corresponds to ``<hosting.load_in_game.enabled>`` in `config.ini`

This option corresponds to ``<map.hosting.load_in_game.enabled>`` in map configuration

This flag is enabled by default.

## \`--join-in-progress-observers\`

This flag allows the game to remain being announced over LAN and PvPGN servers even after it has started. 
Observers may still join the started game, at any of the game slots the map configuration allows.

If the map has Custom Forces enabled, only the designated game slots may be used for observers to watch an 
ongoing game. More than one observer may watch the game concurrently using any game slot.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.join_in_progress.observers>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.join_in_progress.observers>`` in map configuration

This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--no-join-in-progress-observers\`

This flag causes the game to stop being announced over LAN and PvPGN servers as soon as it starts. 
Only observers that were in the lobby by the time the game started will be able to watch the game.

This flag is enabled by default.

## \`--join-in-progress-players\`

This flag allows the game to remain being announced over LAN and PvPGN servers even after it has started. 
Players may still join the started game, at any of the game slots the map configuration allows.

If the map has Custom Forces enabled, only the designated game slots may be used for players to join a game. 
Note that a single game slot cannot be used for more than one actual player, not even if they disconnect.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.join_in_progress.players>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.join_in_progress.players>`` in map configuration

This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--no-join-in-progress-players\`

This flag causes the game to stop being announced over LAN and PvPGN servers as soon as it starts. 
Only players that were in the lobby by the time the game started will be able to play the game.

This option corresponds to ``<hosting.join_in_progress.players>`` in `config.ini`

This option corresponds to ``<map.hosting.join_in_progress.players>`` in map configuration

This flag is enabled by default.

## \`--log-game-commands\`

This flag causes all usage of game commands to be logged persistently.

Note that persistent logs are written to the `aura.log` file.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.log_commands>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.log_commands>`` in map configuration

This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--no-log-game-commands\`

This flag prevents persistent logging of usage of game commands.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.log_commands>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.log_commands>`` in map configuration

This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--auto-start-balanced\`

This flag specifies that the game may only automatically start when the teams are balanced. In order for this 
flag to be effective, other auto start parameters must also be supplied.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.autostart.requires_balance>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.autostart.requires_balance>`` in map configuration

This flag is enabled by default.

## \`--no-auto-start-balanced\`

This flag specifies that the game may automatically start even if the teams are not balanced. In order for this 
flag to be effective, other auto start parameters must also be supplied.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.autostart.requires_balance>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.autostart.requires_balance>`` in map configuration

This flag is disabled by default.

## \`--fast-expire-lan-owner\`

Enables a security measure that instantly removes the lobby owner if they disconnect from a game session joined 
over a Local Area Network (LAN).

Immediate removal minimizes the risk of impersonation, as an unauthenticated player could otherwise attempt to 
reconnect as the lobby owner. By ensuring the owner is removed upon disconnection, the lobby remains secure from 
potential exploits involving owner impersonation.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.expiry.owner.lan>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.expiry.owner.lan>`` in map configuration

This flag is enabled by default.

## \`--no-fast-expire-lan-owner\`

Disables the automatic removal of the lobby owner when they leave a game session joined over LAN.

This may be useful in environments where temporary disconnections are common, but it significantly increases the
risk of impersonation. Without authentication, another player could potentially rejoin as the lobby owner, 
leading to unauthorized control over the game. Use this flag cautiously, as it trusts the legitimacy of the 
owner’s reconnection without verification, potentially exposing the lobby to security vulnerabilities.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.expiry.owner.lan>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.expiry.owner.lan>`` in map configuration

This flag is disabled by default.

# Parameters for CLI games

## \`-s \<TYPE>, --search-type \<TYPE\>\`

Specifies the type of hostable being referenced. This parameter helps Aura determine how to resolve 
the input when hosting maps from the CLI, whether they are maps, configuration files, or remote resources.

**Options:**

- map: Indicates that the specified file is a Warcraft 3 map.
- config: Indicates that the specified file is a map config/metadata file.
- local: Indicates that both maps and config files are allowed, but only in the local machine.
- any: Indicates that the specified file may be found in the cloud.

## \`--exclude \<SERVER\>\`

This makes hosted games invisible in the specified server. The server is to be specified through their 
unique `Input ID`, which corresponds to ``realm_N.input_id`` in `config.ini`. Note that this value may be 
missing, and thus defaults to ``realm_N.unique_name`` (which itself defaults to \`realm_N.host_name\`).

## \`--alias \<ALIAS\>\`

This option lets Aura automatically register an alias for the map hosted. Aliases are case-insensitive, and 
normalized according to the rules listed in \`aliases.ini\`.

## \`--mirror \<IP:PORT\#ID\>\`, \`--mirror \<IP:PORT\#ID:KEY\>\`

This option sets Aura to use game mirroring mode. In this mode, the bot won't host games by itself, but 
instead repost a game hosted elsewhere to connected Battle.net/PvPGN realms. The actual host is identified 
by their IPv4 address and PORT. The game ID, also known as "host counter", should be provided in hexadecimal.

Games originally hosted over LAN require the KEY to be specified.

When mirroring games, the following parameters are likely to also be useful:
- `--exclude`: In order to avoid duplicate broadcasts in the source PvPGN realm, if any.
- `--reconnection`: In order to properly communicate reconnection support to clients using GProxy.
- `--proxy`: Allows mirroring the game over LAN by proxying connections over Aura.

Aura will remain in game mirroring mode until the process finishes.

## \`--observers \<OBSERVER\>\`

This parameter sets the observer mode for the hosted game. Observer mode determines how spectators are 
allowed to observe the game.

**Options:**

- no: No observers allowed. Spectators cannot join the game.
- full: Allows spectators to exclusively observe the game, and chat among themselves.
- referees: Allows spectators to observe the game, and communicate with the players, either in public chat, or private chat.
- defeat: Players that lose the game are allowed to remain in the game, as spectators.

## \`--visibility \<VISIBILITY\>\`

This parameter sets the visibility mode for the hosted game, determining how much of the map is visible 
to players and observers.

**Options:**

- default: Standard visibility mode where players can only see areas of the map revealed by their units and structures.
- hide terrain: Hides terrain from players and observers, making the entire map appear as black fog of war.
- map explored: Reveals the entire map to players, allowing them to see all terrain but not enemy units or structures unless they have vision of them.
- always visible: Grants players and observers full visibility of the entire map, including enemy units and structures, without the need for vision.

## \`--speed \<SPEED\>\`

This parameter sets the speed for the hosted game, determining how often the game updates.
Slower settings make the gameplay more accessible, but are uncommon in competitive environments.

**Options:**

- slow: This is the most accesible setting for new players.
- normal: This is the recommended setting for players new to real-time strategy games.
- fast: This is the most competitive setting. It's also the default game speed.

## \`--realm-visibility \<DISPLAY\>\`

This parameter toggle whether the game is publicly visible in the game lists of
PvPGN realms.

**Options:**

- private: The game can only be joined from PvPGN realms by typing the game name.
- public: The game is visible and clickable in the game lists in PvPGN realms.
- none: The game cannot be joined from PvPGN realms.

## \`--owner \<USER@SERVER>\`

This parameter specifies the owner of the hosted game. The owner is typically the user who has 
administrative control over the game session. Here's the format for specifying the owner:

- USER: The username of the owner.
- SERVER: The server the user is registered in.

## \`--lobby-timeout-mode \<MODE>\`

Sets the conditions that trigger the countdown for the game lobby timeout, based on a pre-configured timeout value.

**Options:**

- never: The timeout countdown will never start, keeping the lobby active indefinitely.
- empty: The countdown starts when the lobby becomes completely empty of players.
- ownerless: The countdown begins if the lobby owner disconnects, even if other players remain in the lobby.
- strict: The countdown starts immediately when the lobby is created and expires solely based on the timeout value,
with no additional conditions.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.expiry.lobby.timeout.mode>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.expiry.lobby.timeout.mode>`` in map configuration

## \`--lobby-owner-timeout-mode \<MODE>\`

Determines when the timeout countdown for game ownership expiration should begin, based on a specified timeout value.

**Options:**

- never: The timeout countdown for ownership will never start, even if the owner is absent.
- absent: The countdown starts when the lobby owner has left the room. Node that this mechanism is independent from
``--fast-expire-lan-owner``, which doesn't use a timer.
- strict: The countdown starts as a new game owner is assigned, and ownership expires solely based on the timeout value,
with no further conditions.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.expiry.owner.timeout.mode>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.expiry.owner.timeout.mode>`` in map configuration

## \`--loading-timeout-mode \<MODE>\`

Defines when the timeout countdown for kicking slow-loading players begins, in conjunction with a set timeout value.

**Options:**

- never: The countdown will not begin, allowing players unlimited time to load.
- strict: The countdown starts as soon as players begin loading,
and any player who exceeds the timeout will be kicked, with no other conditions applied.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.expiry.loading.timeout.mode>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.expiry.loading.timeout.mode>`` in map configuration

## \`--playing-timeout-mode \<MODE>\`

Specifies when the timeout countdown starts for an active game, used together with a predefined timeout duration. Once 
the timeout condition is fulfilled, all players are kicked from the game even if it is still in progress.

**Options:**

- never: The countdown will not be triggered after the game starts, allowing it to continue indefinitely.
- dry: The countdown starts immediately when the game begins, but instead of terminating the game, the
server simulates the expiration process. This mode is primarily used for testing server configuration without 
affecting active sessions or for playfully pressuring players to finish quickly. In dry mode, warnings and 
countdown messages will appear, but the game itself will not be forcibly ended when the timeout is reached.
- strict: The countdown starts as soon as the game begins, and the game will expire purely based on the timeout
value, without any additional conditions.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.expiry.playing.timeout.mode>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.expiry.playing.timeout.mode>`` in map configuration

This parameter specifies the maximum time a map download is allowed to take. Once this time is
exceeded, the map download and game hosting are cancelled.

- TIME: Provided in seconds.

## \`--auto-start-players \<COUNT\>\`

This parameter specifies that the game may automatically start when the provided ``COUNT`` of slots 
have been occupied in the game. This includes computer slots, virtual player slots, and actual players that 
have downloaded the map. Note that, unless configured otherwise, balanced teams are mandatory for the game 
to automatically start.

If \`--auto-start-time\` is also supplied, the game will start only when both conditions are met simultaneously.

This option is equivalent to ``<map.auto_start.players>`` in map configuration

## \`--auto-start-time \<SECONDS\>\`

in milliseconds.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.high_ping.safe_ms>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.high_ping.safe_ms>`` in map configuration

## \`--latency \<VALUE\>\`

This parameter specifies the time, in milliseconds, that should pass between each game tick. All data sent by 
players is forwarded to each other at a rate limited by the provided value.

This option is equivalent to ``<net.stop_lag.sync_limit>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.net.stop_lag.sync_limit>`` in map configuration

## \`--reconnection \<MODE\>\`

This parameter customizes the reconnection support, if any, for the hosted game. For this parameter to be effective,
related config.ini entries must also be enabled.

**Options:**

- disabled: GProxy reconnection not supported for the game.
- basic: GProxy classic reconnection supported. Requires ``<net.tcp_extensions.gproxy.basic.enabled = yes>``
- extended: GProxyDLL extended time reconnection supported, additionally to classic reconnection.
Requires ``<net.tcp_extensions.gproxy.long.enabled = yes>``

This option is equivalent to ``<map.reconnection.mode>`` in map configuration.

## \`--start-countdown-interval \<VALUE\>\`

This parameter specifies, in milliseconds, how long should Aura wait between each tick during the game start countdown.

## \`--hcl\`

This parameter specifies a custom game mode to be prepicked for maps that implement the HCL standard.
For instance, ``--hcl ap`` sets 'All Pick' mode in DotA games.

This flag should never be used for maps that aren't known to support HCL. Otherwise, it will corrupt 
player handicaps.

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hcl>`` in map configuration

## \`--load \<FILE\>\`

Specifies the location of a saved game a game lobby will resume.

- If `<FILE>` does not contain any slashes, it is resolved relative to the saved games directory by default, unless overridden by the `--stdpaths` flag.
- The presence of any slashes causes `<FILE>` to be resolved relative to the current working directory (CWD).

## \`--reserve \<PLAYER\>\`

Makes a reservation for a player to join the game lobby. This is required for loaded games to properly work.

## \`--game-version \<VERSION\>\`

Specifies the main version targetted by a game lobby.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.game_versions.main>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.game_versions.main>`` in map configuration

## \`--game-locale-mod \<LOCALE\>\`

Specifies the locale targetted by a game lobby. This option uses the _Locales feature introduced in game version v1.30.

This option is equivalent to ``<map.locale.mod>`` in map configuration

**Options:**
- enUS
- deDE
- esES
- esMX
- frFR
- itIT
- koKR
- plPL
- ptBR
- ruRU
- zhCN
- zhTW

## \`--game-locale-lang-id \<LOCALE\>\`

Specifies the locale targetted by a game lobby. This option uses the legacy MPQ-based localization feature.
Locale must be specified as a Windows LANGID. 

This option is equivalent to ``<map.locale.lang_id>`` in map configuration

## \`--crossplay \<MODE\>\`

Crossplay adds support for clients running game versions other than the main game version to join the lobby. 
Note that crossplay has an inherent risk of desynchronization between game clients. Usage of this feature is 
only recommended when hosting well-tested maps with custom game data.

Avoid using crossplay for melee or altered melee maps, in order to minimize potential issues. Note, however, that 
maps using SLK optimization, such as those optimized with [W3x2Lni][5], are likely immune against desynchronizations.

**Options:**
- none: Disables crossplay feature entirely.
- conservative: Crossplay is only enabled when Aura is reasonably sure that the map may properly work under crossplay. Note, 
however, that Aura's detection of crossplay capabilities is imperfect.
- optimistic: Crossplay is enabled across a wide range of versions, regardless of the map. In particular, this enables crossplay 
for all game versions ranging from 1.24 to 1.28e.
- force: Crossplay is enabled across all versions enabled, even if they are very likely to desync.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.game_versions.crossplay.mode>`` in `config.ini`

## \`--on-ipflood \<ACTION\>\`

This parameter customizes behavior when an excessive amount of players join the game from the same IP address.

**Options:**

- none: Accepts any amount of players joining from the same IP address.
- notify: Sends a message to the game chat.
- deny: Prevents new players from joining the game.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.ip_filter.flood_handler>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.ip_filter.flood_handler>`` in map configuration

## \`--on-leave\`

This option customizes how the game host handles players who leave a match 
before it concludes. The behavior of leavers can significantly impact 
game balance and the overall experience, especially in team-based or 
competitive Warcraft 3 matches.

Available values for this option:

- **none**: Prevents the game from recognizing a player's departure in any way. 
  Their units remain under their control but idle, and no default victory 
  conditions are triggered. This option is useful for preventing unintended 
  match-ending conditions in custom maps that do not handle leaver logic well.
  
- **native**: Applies the default Warcraft 3 behavior for leavers. In melee team  
  games, when a player leaves, their remaining allies automatically gain shared  
  unit control over the leaver's units and structures. This allows teammates to  
  continue using their army and economy without needing manual intervention.  
  Additionally, victory and defeat conditions function as intended by the game  
  or custom map scripts, ensuring standard gameplay logic remains intact.  
  
- **share**: Similar to ``none``, in that it suppresses standard leave actions, 
  preventing automatic defeat conditions. However, in addition to this, 
  the leaver’s units and structures are transferred to their allies, granting 
  them shared control. This option ensures that a team does not suffer an 
  immediate disadvantage due to a player leaving, as remaining players can 
  take over the abandoned army and economy.

### Use Cases:

- **none**: 
  - Prevents unintended match endings when a player leaves.
  - Useful for certain custom maps where leaver handling should be manually managed.
  - Keeps the game world intact without triggering victory conditions.

- **native**:
  - Maintains expected behavior for melee games and properly coded custom maps.
  - Ensures that the original map logic determines what happens when a player leaves.
  - Prevents potential unintended side effects from suppressing leave actions.

- **share**:
  - Ideal for team-based matches where players want to mitigate the impact of a leaver.
  - Ensures a team can continue playing competitively even if a member disconnects.
  - Useful in cooperative game modes where unit persistence is desirable.

This option provides flexibility for different match styles, allowing the host 
to customize leaver behavior to best suit the game mode and players' expectations.

The default setting is `native`.

## \`--on-share\`

This option customizes how the game handles unit sharing between players.  
Unit sharing allows players to grant allies control over their units at any time,  
without requiring the recipient's consent. This can be useful in team-based matches  
for cooperative play, assisting teammates, or managing another player's forces.  
However, some game modes or competitive scenarios may require restrictions on unit sharing.

Available values for this flag:

- native: Allows players to freely share unit control with their allies at any time.  
  This is the default Warcraft 3 behavior and is commonly used in team-based games  
  where coordination is encouraged.  

- kick: Enforces strict rules against unit sharing by instantly kicking any player  
  who grants shared unit control to another. This setting is useful for preventing  
  any form of unintended or unfair assistance in competitive matches or custom  
  game modes that require individual control integrity.  

- restrict: Prevents shared unit control from being used by blocking the player  
  who receives shared control from issuing any actions. If the original player  
  (the sharer) does not revoke the shared control within 5 seconds, they are  
  kicked from the game. This ensures that unit sharing cannot be exploited while  
  still allowing a brief window for mistakes to be corrected.  

### Potential Dangers:

#### native:
- Players can enable shared control without realizing its consequences, allowing  
  teammates to issue unwanted commands that disrupt their strategy.  
- Malicious players could interfere with an ally’s game by mismanaging their army  
  or economy.  
- In competitive matches, this setting may enable unfair assistance, where one player  
  manages multiple armies to gain an advantage.  

#### kick:
- A player who enables shared control, even momentarily, is immediately removed  
  from the game, which may feel overly punitive.  
- Malicious players could trick others into enabling shared control, causing them  
  to be kicked unfairly.  
- A player under pressure in a fast-paced game may toggle unit sharing without  
  thinking, leading to an unintended removal.  

#### restrict:
- **Critical gameplay impact**: In a real-time strategy (RTS) game, every second  
  matters. Blocking a player's ability to issue commands for up to 5 seconds  
  can be devastating, especially in battles or high-pressure situations.  
- **Severe disadvantage in combat**: A player who receives shared control will  
  suddenly be unable to move units, cast spells, or control their economy. If this  
  happens during an attack, their forces may be wiped out due to inaction.  
- **Unintended team sabotage**: If an ally mistakenly shares control at a crucial  
  moment, it could cost their teammate an entire engagement, base, or even the game.  
- **Confusion and frustration**: Players who receive shared control may not  
  immediately realize why their controls are locked, leading to unnecessary panic  
  or accusations of bugs.  
- **Potential for abuse**: While the sharer is the one who faces removal if they  
  do not revoke control, a coordinated group of players could still use this system  
  to disrupt a game by repeatedly enabling shared control to distract or disadvantage  
  others.  

### Use Cases:

- **native**:  
  - Ideal for team-based games where coordination is encouraged.  
  - Allows players to share control freely for strategic advantages.  
  - Matches standard Warcraft 3 behavior, making it suitable for most maps.  

- **kick**:  
  - Enforces strict individual control by immediately removing players who  
    attempt to share units.  
  - Best suited for competitive modes where unit sharing is considered an  
    unfair advantage.

- **restrict**:  
  - Blocks shared unit control without immediately removing the offending player.  
  - Provides an 5-second grace period to revoke shared control before kicking  
    the player, preventing accidental violations.  
  - Ensures fair play while still allowing for minor mistakes to be corrected.  
  - However, **game hosts must be fully aware of the risks**, as the action-blocking  
    effect can critically harm gameplay and lead to significant losses in key moments.  

This flag provides hosts with flexible options to control how unit sharing  
functions, ensuring that it aligns with the intended balance and fairness  
of a given game mode.  

Defaults to `native`.  

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.game_protocol.share_handler>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.game_protocol.share_handler>`` in map configuration

## \`--on-unsafe-name \<ACTION\>\`

This parameter customizes behavior when a player tries to join a game using an unsafe or otherwise problematic name.

**Options:**

- none: Allow them to join.
- censor: Removes unsafe characters from their name. In some maps, usage of this option may cause desynchronization between players.
- deny: Prevents them from joining the game.

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.name_filter.unsafe_handler>`` in map configuration

## \`--on-broadcast-error \<ACTION\>\`

This parameter customizes behavior when a game fails to be announced in one of the connected PvPGN realms.

**Options:**

- ignore: No action taken.
- exit-main-error: If a game cannot be announced in one of the main PvPGN realms, the game lobby is closed.
- exit-empty-main-error: If a game with no users cannot be announced in one of the main PvPGN realms, the game lobby is closed.
- exit-any-error: If a game cannot be announced in one of the connected PvPGN realms, the game lobby is closed.
- exit-empty-any-error: If a game with no users cannot be announced in one of the connected PvPGN realms, the game lobby is closed.

## \`--hide-ign-started\`

This parameter customizes whether Aura will obfuscate players names after the game starts.
By customizing this parameter, players names may effectively be hidden or revealed in some contexts.

**Options:**

- never: Players names are revealed.
- host: Players names are hidden in the output of many commands and status reports.
- always: Players names are hidden in the output of many commands and status reports. Additionally, 
when used together with --hide-ign, any hosted map will also be unaware of the identities of non-local 
players. When used this way, games running certain maps may desync.
- auto: This is the default. Players names are obfuscated in FFA games where there are 3 or more players.

This option is equivalent to ``<hosting.nicknames.hide_in_game>`` in `config.ini`

This option is equivalent to ``<map.hosting.nicknames.hide_in_game>`` in map configuration

# Flags for CLI commands

## \`--exec-broadcast\`

This flag enables broadcasting the command execution to all users or players in the channel. 
When activated, the command specified by --exec will be broadcasted to all users in the same 
realm or game, ensuring transparency and visibility of the executed action.

By using this flag, users or players will be informed about the command being executed, fostering 
a collaborative and informed environment during the game session.

# Parameters for CLI commands

## \`--exec \<COMMAND\>\`

This parameter allows the execution of a specific command after the bot start up, and the CLI game (if any) 
has been created. Here's how it works:

- COMMAND: The command to be executed. The command token is not to be included (e.g. ! or .)

## \`--exec-as \<USER@SERVER>\`

This parameter specifies the user and server on which the command specified by --exec should be executed. 
It allows the execution of commands as a specific user on a particular server. Here's the format:

- USER: The username to whom the command is attributed.
- SERVER: The server the user is registered in.

## \`--exec-auth \<AUTH\>\`

This parameter sets the authentication mode for executing commands specified by --exec.

**Options:**

- spoofed: Treats the user as unverified by their respective server.
- verified: Treats the user as verified by their respective server.
- admin: Treats the user as an admin of their server.
- rootadmin: Treats the user as a root admin of their server.
- sudo: Treats the user as a bot sudoer. These are the highest privileges.

## \`--exec-online\`

This flag defers the execution of the command specified by --exec until the bot has successfully connected 
to the associated server. It ensures that the command is only executed in an online state, with a confirmed 
connection to the intended destination.

Use this flag when the command relies on server-side validation, interaction, or any server-dependent 
resources.

This flag is enabled by default.

## \`--exec-offline\`

This flag forces the command specified by --exec to be executed eagerly, without waiting for the bot 
to connect to the associated server. It enables the execution of commands that do not require 
server connectivity or are safe to run in an offline context.

Use this flag when the command is purely local or when immediate execution is desired regardless 
of connection status.
