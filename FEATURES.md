# Reworked features from [GHost++][2]:
- Admin game:
  There is no specific setting to host a game that grants unlimited permissions to
  anyone who knows or guesses the password transmitted through insecure TCP.

  Instead, the CLI flag `--replaceable` can be provided when hosting a game. 
  This allows players that join the game to use the `!host` command inside to create 
  another game lobby, thereafter replacing the original lobby.

  When the new game lobby starts, if the CLI flag `--auto-rehost` was provided,
  the replaceable lobby will be created again.

# Removed features from [GHost++][2]:
- CASC:
  Bots owners are encouraged to extract the good old MPQ files (i.e., `.w3x`.) and place
  them in the `<bot.maps_path>` folder.

  Much of the same applies for necessary `Blizzard.j` and `common.j`, which should be placed 
  in the `<bot.jass_path>` folder.

- Localization:
  I like localization, but it's quite a bit of work. PRs are welcome.

- Replays:
  Please open an issue if this is important to you.
